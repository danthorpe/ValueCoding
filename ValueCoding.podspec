  ValueCoding is a simple pair of protocols to support the archiving
  and unarchiving of Swift value types.

  It works by allowing a value type, which must conform to ValueCoding
  to define via a typealias its archiver. The archiver is another type
  which implements the ArchiverType protocol. This type will typically
  be an NSObject which implements NSCoding and is an adaptor which is
  responsible for encoding and decoding the properties of the value.
